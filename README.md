# PONYTOWN INTRO

(short and simple bc i dont know how to work this goddamn site)

- she/he + other pronouns
- multi-sourced headmate so you may see alot of ponies of mine that say [ SYS ] on them, all are me and saying i'm not them is does nothing to me!
- i have SUPER bad anxiety and moodswings sometimes so always just int with care w/ me
- feel free to boop me, kiss me, whatever!
- autistic/adhd/etc so i get very dumb at times
- if afk please whisp to me so i can get ur message!
- will probably not accept ur friend request if we barely talked to eachother on pt
- mostly at spawn w/ friends
